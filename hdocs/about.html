      <h4>The REDACTED Realm; In the Beginning</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the beginning, REDACTED was a world like any other, however this was
        destined to change when calamity struck nearly causing an apocalyptical
        event. The only way to prevent this was the System. This System is named
        Yggdrasil and was put in place at the core of the world to save it, so
        that those that inhabit it and those that come to inhabit it can all
        live and thrive. As the years became decades became centuries, the old
        civilization came to an end as the world came to a soft reset, the old
        buildings being buried or lost to the sands of time. The only remnant
        now is the Labyrinth, a planet wide dungeon. As elvin life has gone on,
        they were joined by humans, dwarves, and other races that came to
        inhabit REDACTED. REDACTEDâ€™s main continent is Sladridor, named for the
        old elvin kingdom that once encompassed the continent. The Elves of
        Sladridor came <b>before</b> all other races were introduced to
        REDACTED, in fact the Kingdom of Sladridor was taken down by an alliance
        of humans, dwarves and some others seeking fair and equal treatment,
        after which the alliance divided Sladridor into smaller kingdoms. The
        only remaining of those original kingdoms being that of Dwarga-ur, the
        dwarven kingdom under the Spine'ed Mountains.
